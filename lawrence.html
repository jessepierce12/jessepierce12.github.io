    	<p><h1> My High School Experience (part 2/2)</h1></p>

        <p>Lawrence Academy is a Prep School is Groton, Massachussetts. It is known for sending their athletes to play sports in college at the D1 level as well as D3 and D2.</p>

       <P> I went there repeating my junior year and for my senior year in the hopes to play college hockey but unfortunately, my love and drive for the game diminished at the hands of my coach</P>

       <p> Here, I did more of my school work but not to the highest level I could have. I spent a lot of time playing sports and hanging out in the dorms with my friends</p>
