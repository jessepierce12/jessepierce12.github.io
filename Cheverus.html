    	<p><h1> My High School Experience (part 1/2)</h1></p>

       <p> Cheverus is a private Catholic Jesuit prep school in Portland, Maine.</p>

       <p>I went to Cheverus from Freshman year through Junior year</p>

       <p>I did not do a whole lot of school work while I was there but I loved playing sports for them. We always had rockin' student sections to make the atmosphere rowdy.</p>
